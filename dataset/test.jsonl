2019", "summary": "Tabular datasets are constructed by extracting and organizing information from data sources. These data sources can be structured such as databases, Knowledge Graphs (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia, ORKG), semi-structured such as tables or unstructured such as text in scientific literature. To increase the utility of tabular datasets, they are annotated by matching their content to Knowledge Graphs classes, properties and instances. This is called tabular data annotation or tabular data to knowledge graph matching.\n\n\nSemantic Table to Knowledge Graph Matching (SemTab) challenge aims at providing a common framework to conduct a systematic evaluation of datasets and systems published by researchers. Thus, since 2019, SemTab@ISWC is publishing researchers' contributions to this research problem. The following comparison table presents all the systems proposed by the SemTab community since 2019. It is built using a template (https://orkg.org/template/R286081), that can be considered as a conceptual model for the semantification of SemTab systems papers using ORKG. In this table, the left panel contains the different comparison criterion used and the right panel the different contributions of the authors.\n"}, "id": "R642266"}

Agroecology Use Case in the ORKG: A mini-review on how legume intercrops affect cereal grain yields", "summary": "Increasing on-farm biodiversity by growing two or more types of crops together (i.e., intercropping) has the potential to provide multiple benefits, including increased crop yield. This comparison looks at the yield effects of intercropping legumes\u2014plants that make atmospheric nitrogen available to other plants\u2014with cereal crops. The original aim of the comparison was to focus on European studies that evaluate how intercropping legumes with cereal crops affects cereal crop grain yield relative to cereal crop monocultures, cropping systems where individuals of the same crop species are planted together. However, the regional focus on Europe was expanded slightly to include one additional study conducted in Canada (and published in a European journal), as the original literature search yielded relatively few usable scientific articles (described below). The goal of this comparison is to provide an agroecology use case in the ORKG that demonstrates the utility of this platform for scoping articles in the field of ecology, rather than to conduct a robust synthesis on the topic of legume intercrops.\n\nThe original search for scientific articles was conducted in Web of Science and included the following search terms: \"legum* intercrop*\" OR \"legum* polyculture\" AND (\"grain yield\" OR \"cereal yield\" OR \"grain productivity\" OR \"cereal productivity\" OR \"grain biomass\" OR \"cereal biomass\") AND (effective* OR performance* OR assessment* OR evaluation* OR estimate* OR comparison* OR contrast*) AND Europe*. This search was conducted in October 2022 and yielded 34 articles. Selected articles include those that were either open access or accessible through the University of Leibniz, Hannover Technical Information Library, and that provided information on cereal crop yields in the text or in tables; data presented in figures or plots that required extraction were not included in this comparison. Data from four papers met these eligibility criteria and were included in the comparison.\n"}, "id": "R655553"}

contributions.", "answer": {"title": "Effect of Legume Rotations on Cereal Crop Yields in Europe ", "summary": "Crop rotations\u2014sequentially planting different crop species on the same plot of land\u2014are an important strategy for building soil fertility and ultimately for supporting crop yields. This comparison includes European studies that evaluate the effect of legume crop rotations on cereal crop yields relative to continuous crop monocultures, cropping systems where the same crop species is repeatedly planted on the same plot of land over time. Papers included in the comparison were identified through a Web of Science search that included the following search terms: \"legum* rotation*\" AND (\"grain yield\" OR \"cereal yield\" OR \"grain productivity\" OR \"cereal productivity\" OR \"grain biomass\" OR \"cereal biomass\") AND (effective* OR performance* OR assessment* OR evaluation* OR estimate* OR comparison* OR contrast*) AND Europe*. Selected papers include those that were either open access or accessible through the University of Leibniz, Hannover Technical Information Library, and that provided information on cereal crop yields in the text or in tables; data presented in figures or plots that required extraction were not included in this comparison. The search yielded 29 papers; data from three papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the comparison.\n\n*This is an updated version of the original comparison published in October 2022. In this new version, I added a property, \"has effect\", to provide a qualitative summary of the effect of the legume rotation on the crop yield (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral). I also fixed a numerical typo associated with the Tamm et al. publication."}, "id": "R655555"}
