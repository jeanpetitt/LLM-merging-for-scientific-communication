{"title": "Comparison of Nitrogen Dynamics in Alfisol and Vertisol Soils under Rainfed Rice-Based Systems", "summary": "This comparison aims to investigate the differences in nitrogen dynamics and crop growth between Alfisol and Vertisol soils under a direct-seeded rainfed lowland rice-based system. The study focuses on nitrogen dynamics, crop growth, and the impact of soil type on these factors. The research problem is to understand how soil type influences nitrogen dynamics and crop growth in a rainfed rice-based system.", "id": "R221864"}
{"title": "Ablation study of soil phosphorus content in West African soils", "summary": "The comparison table (https://orkg.org/comparison/R657613/) shows that the soil phosphorus content system composed of the context encoder, ingredient decoder and ingredient substitution decoder modules outperforms the baselines on all metrics. The following table presents the ablation study to investigate the contribution of each module and different data modalities (recipe sets, ingredients sets) of the system. This table demonstrates that the three modules allow the best performance of the system.", "id": "R222164"}
{"title": "Comparative Analysis of Intercropping Systems for Cereal Crop Yield and Grain Quality", "summary": "This comparison reviews various intercropping systems involving cereal crops like durum wheat, triticum durum, maize, and lupin with soybean, red clover, and lentil, focusing on yield, grain quality, and the effects of different cropping arrangements on crop yield and grain quality.", "id": "R655553"}
{"title": "Comparative Analysis of Leguminous Pre-Crops and Subsequ01sequent Cereal Yields", "summary": "This dataset compiles research findings from various studies examining the impact of different leguminous pre-crops on the yield of subsequent cereal crops. The contributions cover a range of crops including barley, durum wheat, spring wheat, oat, and rye, and assess the effects of leguminous pre-crops such as red clover, alsike clover, lupine, white sweet clover, and others on grain yield, aboveground biomass, and nitrogen availability. The dataset aims to provide insights into the benefits of incorporating leguminous crops into cereal crop rotations for improved yield and soil health.", "id": "R655555"}
