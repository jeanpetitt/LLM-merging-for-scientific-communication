The research problem focuses on improving soil quality and crop yields through legume intercropping.", "id": "R217421"}
{"title": "Comparison of Soil Nitrogen Dynamics in Different Cropping Systems and Soil Types", "summary": "This comparison analyzes the total mineral nitrogen content in various soil treatments, including soybean, stylo, and cowpea rotations, as well as control groups. The study locations include Raipur, Tsbiri, and Nigeria. The comparison also includes two soil types, Alfisol and Vertisol, and examines the nitrogen dynamics in a direct-seeded rainfed lowland rice-based system. The analysis includes measurement values, units, standard errors, number of replicates, measurement locations, and the experimental setup. The research problem and intervention are not explicitly stated, but the focus is on understanding the impact of different cropping systems and soil types on soil nitrogen content.", "id": "R221864"}
{"title": "Comparison of Phosphorus Content in Soil under Different Cropping Systems in the Northern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria", "summary": "This comparison analyzes the phosphorus content in soil under three different cropping systems (soybean, cowpea, and maize monoculture) in the Northern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria. The data is derived from two studies, one focusing on the influence of cereal-legume rotation on Striga control and maize grain yield, and the other examining the effects of acidification on a kaolinitic Alfisol under continuous cropping with nitrogen fertilization. The comparison considers factors such as measurement location, measurement value, unit, standard error, number of replicates, study location, and experimental setup.", "id": "R222164"}
{"title": "Comparison of Crop Yields in Intercropping Systems and Relay Intercropping of Durum Wheat and Lentil", "summary": "This comparison analyzes 18 contributions that investigate crop yield in intercropping systems and relay intercropping of durum wheat and lentil. The studies were conducted in Italy and Sweden, using field experiments. The research problem focuses on crop yield control and quality, with cereal crops including durum wheat, soybean, lupin, red clover, and lucerne. The experimental design varies, with some studies using generalized linear mixed models and analysis of variance. The studies compare the effects of different intercrops and relay intercrops on corn grain yield, with some providing measurement values, standard errors, and number of replicates. Additionally, three contributions focus on the use of relay intercropping of durum wheat and lentil to stabilize crop yields under contrasting climatic conditions.", "id": "R655553"}
{"title": "Comparison of Cereal Crop Yield and Aboveground Biomass in Different Leguminous Pre-Crop Rotations", "summary": "This comparison analyzes and compares 30 contributions that focus on the impact of various leguminous pre-crops (such as red clover, alsike clover, lupine, white sweet clover, alexandria clover, and crimson clover) on the grain yield and aboveground biomass of cereal crops (barley, oat, wheat, and rye) in two consecutive years. The research problem revolves around the effects of these leguminous pre-crops on the yield and quality of succeeding cereal crops. The experimental design is based on field experiments, and the experimental setup varies between the contributions. The cereal crops are standardized to barley, oat, wheat, and rye, and the control is timothy-grass. The research interventions are the different leguminous pre-crops, and the effects are measured in terms of grain yield and aboveground biomass, with their respective standard deviations and number of replicates. The measurements are provided in appropriate units, and the studies are conducted in various countries, including Denmark, Estonia, Italy, and others.", "id": "R655555"}
